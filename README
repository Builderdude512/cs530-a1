Files Manifest:
    makefile
    main.cpp
    xed.cpp

Compile Instructions:
    Run 'make' from the project root directory.
    This will output the 'xed' executable.

Operating Instructions:
    Usage: xed [-b] filename
        -b -- output as binary.

Design Features:
    Core functionality is two functions that print a single line,
    one for binary and one for hex. These are called by two functions
    that repeatably call those two line functions. The main function 
    serves as something to choose whether it goes towards the binary
    or hex route.

Extra:
    I had to manually write a print to binary function as printf()
    did not have such a formater.

Lessons Learned:
    * How to open read a file.
    * How to read the file chunk by chunk.
    * How to output data into different formats.
    * How to make a makefile.
